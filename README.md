# Commerce Physical

Provides API support for working with physical product types in Backdrop Commerce.

Commerce supports the creation of custom product types that contain the fields you need to describe the products you sell, but the core modules don't define any fields specific to physical products. That sort of functionality is now possible through fields defined by the Physical Fields project, and this module works with that module to provide API support for physical product types within Commerce.

## Installation
